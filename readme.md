# dbThrottle
Python Class to run code with consideration to DB load.

## Why
Throttling code to work under the constraints of a server makes sense in certain situations, especially when replica lag comes into play. This project hopes to simplify acting on this consideration.

## What
A, still early, python module, which introduces a functional type to complete a task or continiously run an operation, taking database load and similar metrics into account.
